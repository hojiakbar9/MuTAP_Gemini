# Effective Test Generation using pre-trained Large Language Models and Mutation Testing

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for integrating Google's Gemini language model into the MuTAP (Mutation Testing-based Augmented Prompting) framework for automated test case generation. The goal is to leverage the capabilities of Gemini to generate, refine, and evaluate test cases using mutation testing.

## Features

- **Integration with Gemini 1.5 Flash**: Utilizes the advanced capabilities of Gemini for improved test case generation.
- **Mutation Testing**: Employs mutation testing to evaluate the effectiveness of generated test cases.
- **Automated Test Generation**: Automatically generates and refines test cases for various Python functions.
- **Comparison with Other LLMs**: Provides comparative analysis with other large language models like Codex and llama-2-chat.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- An API key for Gemini API
